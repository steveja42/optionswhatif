	<h1>Terms of Service ("Terms")</h1>


	<p>Last updated: May 18, 2019</p>


	<p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the OptionsWhatIf website
		or addon (the "Service") operated by Resultify ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

	<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These
		Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>

	<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms
		then you may not access the Service. The Terms of Service agreement for OptionsWhatIf has been created with the
		help of <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/">TermsFeed</a>.</p>




	<h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>

	<p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by
		OptionsWhatIf.</p>

	<p>OptionsWhatIf has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices
		of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that OptionsWhatIf shall not be
		responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in
		connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web
		sites or services.</p>

	<p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or
		services that you visit.</p>


	<h2>Termination</h2>

	<p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
		whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

	<p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including,
		without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>



	<h2>Governing Law</h2>

	<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Washington, United States, without
		regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

	<p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If
		any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these
		Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and
		supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

	<h2>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
	<p> We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy
		using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.</p>

	<p>
		OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER RESULTIFY NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR
		DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE
		CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR
		ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.
	</p>

	<p>
		SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
		PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Liability for our Services

	<p>
		WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, RESULTIFY, AND RESULTIFY'S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST
		PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

	</p>
	<p>
		TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RESULTIFY, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY
		CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE
		SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).

	</p>
	<p>
		IN ALL CASES, RESULTIFY, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT
		REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

	</p>
	<h2>Business uses of our Services</h2>
	<p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless
		and indemnify Resultify and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising
		from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising
		from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>


	<h2>Changes</h2>

	<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is
		material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a
		material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
